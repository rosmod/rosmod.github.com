{% include JB/setup %}

RCPS is composed of the following:

* A linux server (DEV)
* A windows physics simulation machine (SIM)
* 32 Beaglebone Blacks (BBB)
* A configurable (smart) network switch
* A basic network switch

# DEV machine (linux server)

The linux server provides the following roles:

* NGINX web-server for providing port routing to
  * rcps.isis.vanderbilt.edu : a static page site
  * rosmod.rcps.isis.vanderbilt.edu : a ROSMOD webgme server
  * tes.rcps.isis.vanderbilt.edu : a TES GridlabD webgme server
* Internet gateway (with NAT and masquerading) for the BBB cluster
* Remote access (through key-authenticated ssh) for DEV and the cluster

## NGINX setup

The NGINX serer provides the ability to resolve the various DNS names
(*.rcps.isis.vanderbilt.edu) to specific servers on the same
machine. The configuration file for the NGINX server manager can be
found in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.

### Security certificate management

Since the webgme servers that we run (TES, ROSMOD) must support
authentication, they must be able to run over HTTPS. This in turn
requires that they have valid security certificates.

## RCPS site setup

## ROSMOD server setup

The ROSMOD server is able to be run as a system service using commands
like:

```bash
sudo start rosmod
sudo restart rosmod
sudo stop rosmod
```

The ability to run it as a service (and also its configuration) is
provided by the file `/etc/init/rosmod.conf`. The actual code for the
ROSMOD server is found in `/home/jeb/Repositories/webgme-rosmod`,
which is a clone of github.com/rosmod/webgme-rosmod.

The ROSMOD server also has an ancillary configuration file,
`/etc/init/rosmod-dev.conf`, which allows you to run it in _dev_ mode,
under which the **META** is able to be edited. This is possible only if the regular rosmod service is not currently running.  If so, then the rosmod-dev server can be controlled by

```bash
sudo start rosmod-dev
sudo restart rosmod-dev
sudo stop rosmod-dev
```

No matter what mode it runs in, the webgme-rosmod server always
outputs its log to `/var/log/rosmod.log`.

## TES server setup

The tes server is able to be run as a system service using commands
like:

```bash
sudo start tes
sudo restart tes
sudo stop tes
```

The ability to run it as a service (and also its configuration) is
provided by the file `/etc/init/tes.conf`. The actual code for the TES
server is found in `/home/jeb/Repositories/webgme-gridlabd`, which is
a clone of github.com/finger563/webgme-gridlabd.

The TES server always outputs its log to `/var/log/tes.log`.

## Gateway setup

The gateway functionality for the server is configured by

* setting the `ip_forward` control to `1` so that it forwards relevant
  traffic for other nodes

```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

* Setting up IPTables to properly forward traffic between the DEV
  machine's two interfaces (eth0: internet side, eth1: BBB cluster
  side).  NOTE: this command already exists within `/etc/rc.local`
  which is run every time the machine reboots.

```bash
iptables-restore < /home/jeb/utils/iptables.conf
```

  Where `/home/jeb/utils/iptables.conf` contains

```bash
# Generated by iptables-save v1.4.21 on Thu Jul 28 13:39:12 2016
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [232:21394]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [59:4684]
-A FORWARD -i eth1 -j ACCEPT
COMMIT
# Completed on Thu Jul 28 13:39:12 2016
# Generated by iptables-save v1.4.21 on Thu Jul 28 13:39:12 2016
*nat
:PREROUTING ACCEPT [138:21945]
:INPUT ACCEPT [79:16517]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [2:140]
:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
-A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
COMMIT
# Completed on Thu Jul 28 13:39:12 2016
```

  which was created by configuring iptables using:

```bash
iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface eth1 -j ACCEPT
iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface eth0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables-save > /home/jeb/utils/iptables.conf
```

## Remote access setup

The server is configured (through `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to accept
only key-based remote logins, using the key provided in
`/home/jeb/.ssh/id_rsa_jetsontk1`, under the username `jeb`.

With this same key you can log into any of the nodes (conveniently
defined as `node1` through `node32` in the `/etc/hosts` file) using
either `debian` or `root` as the username, e.g.

```bash
ssh -i /home/jeb/.ssh/id_rsa_jetsontk1 root@node1
ssh -i /home/jeb/.ssh/id_rsa_jetsontk1 debian@node1
```
