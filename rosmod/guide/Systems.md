# Systems

The `Systems` folder provides a place to group the different `System` definitions on which you might like to run the software defined in the `Software` model.  When _compiling_ the software using the `SoftwareGenerator` plugin from the project's _root_ aspect, the different system models are used to determine for which computer `architectures` to compile the software.
