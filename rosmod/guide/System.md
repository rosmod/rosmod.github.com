# System

In a `System` model, you define `Hosts`, `Users`, `Networks`, and `Links`:

## Hosts

The `Hosts` which are computers with a specified **OS**, **Architecture**, **Device ID**, and **Device ID Command**.  The **Device ID** allows the user to delineate between two different devices (e.g. a BeagleBone Black and an NVIDIA Jetson TK1) which may have the same _Architecture_ (e.g. `armv7l`), but may need to be separated for binary/library incompatibility.  Because these devices may have different subsystems, we allow the user to specify the **Device ID Command** which is run on the host and should return a string containing the specified _Device ID_.  Hosts can have any number of `Interface` *children*, which are displayed as `ports` on the `Host`.

## Users

The `Users` which have an associated **SSH Key** location and **Directory**.  The user's **Directory** is where any processes started during experiment deployment or compilation on behalf of the user will be run and where any artifacts will be generated.

## Networks

A Network defines the **Subnet** of IP addresses available as well as the **Netmask** which, together with the **Subnet** defines the range of available IP addresses.

## Links

Links connect a _hosts_ `Interface` to a `Network` and has an associated **IP** address that the interface will have on that network.  The user can create links and assign the IP addresses by clicking and dragging from the host's interface to a network.  The IP address is displayed on the link and can be edited by clicking on the Link and editing its IP property in the `Property Panel`.
