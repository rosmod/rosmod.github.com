# Example Receiver Component

Inside the component, the user can define the interaction ports the component supports (i.e. any `publisher`, `subscriber`, `client`, and `server` objects), by dragging and dropping them into the component's canvas.  The relevant `Message` or `Service` pointers for these objects can be defined by either creating the port by dragging the relevant `Message` or `Service` object from the `Tree Browser` into the canvas and selecting the appropriate port type from the pop-up dialog or by dragging the `Message` or `Service` object onto the relevant `Pointer` of the already created port.  Alternatively, the `Message` or `Service` object can be dragged on to the port in the canvas.

For `Subscribers`, `Servers`, and `Timers`, you can edit the `Operation` which gets executed on behalf of the object by double clicking on the object to open a `CodeEditor` with the operation code.

## Timers

Inside this aspect is where the user can specify the c++ code that will execute upon the expiry of the relevant `timer`, or when relevant data is received for a `subscriber` or `server`. The attributes for the ports and timers can be specified in this aspect as well. These attributes include the `period` of the `timer` or the `deadline` of the subscriber operation, for instance.

## Libraries

Also inside this aspect is where the user can select the `Set Editor` visualizer, which allows the user to see or configure the _set_ of **Libraries** that the component requires for compilation/execution. The user can drag a `Source Library` or `System Library` from the `Tree Browser` to into the `Libraries` Set Editor to add the library as a requirement for the component.

## Constraints

The user can drag in `constraints` from the `Part Browser` and name them accordingly to specify that the component must be deployed onto a `Host` which has a `Capability` with a name that matches the constraint's name.

## Description

This component acts as an example for an event-triggered component, which only executes when it receives the appropriate `Message` subscription operation or `Service` request.  The c++ code which executes when these operations are triggered can be found in the `Operation` of the respective `subscriber` and `server`.
