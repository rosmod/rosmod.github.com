# Node

A node can contain any number of **Instances** of `Components` defined in the `Software` model.  A node also has a **Priority** attribute which specifies the linux scheduling priority of the node's process, respectively.

> NOTE:: To create a `Component` _Instance_, you __never__ drag from the `Part Browser`, but must instead drag and drop a `Component` from this project's `Software` model into the canvas and select `Create Instance Here`.
>

By creating `Component Instances` in this way, the user can go into a Component Instance and change attributes, e.g. a `Timer`'s **Period** or **Priority**, which will not require a code re-compilation.  Further, any changes made to the original component in the software model will automatically propagate to any `Component Instances` that have been created from it.  Any changes made to the instance will _override_ the original component's properties, but will not affect the original component or any other component instances.  To make such changes to timer or other port properties, simply double click on the newly created **instance** and select the relevant port, after which you may edit its attributes.  Once an attribute has been over-ridden, any changes made to the original port attribute or component attribute will not reflect in the instance.

Similarly, the component instance's `User Configuration` attribute can be over-ridden here to provide instance-specific configuration parameters, which are more powerful, complex configuration data than command line arguments (see the `Component` documentation in the `Software`).

Finally, each `Component Instance` corresponds to a separate thread of the `Node`'s process.
