# Experiment

An experiment maps a `Deployment`'s abstract grouping of component instances into processes and finally into `Containers` to `Hosts` from the selected `System`.  

## RunExperiment Plugin

The mapping and experiment deployment is performed automatically by the `RunExperiment` plugin based on which `Hosts` are reachable and not busy (i.e. not running any other experiment or compilation processes) from the selected system, and also ensures that the hosts satisfy all of the constraints from all of the component instances in a container's nodes.  If there are not enough hosts for the number of containers or if the constraints of the software cannot be satisfied by the available hosts, the `RunExperiment` plugin informs the user, else the plugin finishes the deployment and saves the mapping into the model for reference and showing to the user.

## StopExperiment Plugin

If an experiment is currently running (based on the existence of model objects corresponding to the mapping of containers to hosts), the `StopExperiment` plugin will stop all the associated experiment processes and copy back all the components' generated logs.  The logs are saved onto the server file system and their contents are also copied into attributes of an automatically created `Results` object, whose name will be the current time at which the experiment finished.  If the user opens the `Results` object and selects the `ResultsViz` visualizer, any tracing logs that were recovered will be automatically plotted in the canvas.
